Project: Sign-up Form

https://jufarkas.github.io/sign-up-form/

This will be my sign-up form from The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS Course; to showcase what I've learned regarding HTML forms.

Should also add, the form doesn't submit anywhere/'to' anything, the submit button just completes the action if the fields are valid. Can also confirm in index.html file.
